Create a Python function called LongestWord(sen) that takes in a string as its parameter and returns the longest word in the string. If there are two or more words with the same length, the function should return the first word that appears in the string with that length. The function should ignore any punctuation marks in the string, and it should assume that the input string will not be empty. Additionally, the words in the input string may include numbers, such as "Hello world123 567".

## Examples

```
Input: "fun&!! time"
Output: time
```

```
Input: "I love dogs"
Output: love
```
